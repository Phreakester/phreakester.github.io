A design-a-thon is similar to a hack-a-thon,\n            but specifically focuses of the aspects of design and ideation instead of the actual integration and development of the project\n            that would normally happen during a hack-a-thon. This design-a-thon was hosted by Bruin Entreprneurs at UCLA and our prompt was\n            how to accomodate a large increase in population density in Los Angeles without increasing its size.</p>\n            <p> Our solution was to apply the urban design concept of superblocks to Los Angeles. Superblocks involve enveloping multiple\n            city blocks into one larger one, redirecting traffic around it and reserving the middle roads for pedestrians. This creates\n            more space for community green spaces and reduces noise pollution as citizens are further from the streets. Superblocks\n            would also llow people easy access to local buisnesses such as grocers or barbers, reducing the need to drive and reducing congestion.</p>\n            <img className='ppage-img' src={screen_img} alt='Screenshot showing line art of a public space'/>\n            <p>I had a fantastic time competing in the design-a-thon, and I learned much about the design process, from ideation and brainstorming\n            to pitching and presenting.

It is a tried-and-true\n                method of going from idea to sound with very little friction. As I tried to learn a bit about \n                electronic music production over quarintine, I wanted to get my hands on one. However, I quickly\n                found that any keyboard that would be able to interface with my software would be much more expensive\n                than I could justify.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                I did however have an old electronic keyboard my mom used to use, but it had no ouput besides its \n                built in speakers. The actual keyboard and other parts still worked well enough however, so \n                I looked into adding a MIDI interface to it. From my initial disassembly of the leybpard, I saw\n                that the keyboard connected the keys to the motherboard using a rather large ribbon cable.\n            </p>\n            <img src={dissassembly_pic} className='ppage-img' />\n            <p>\n                The problem was that I didn't understand how the cable could encode all the keys in only 16 wires\n                given how many keys the keyboard had. Further research suggested that the keys used a scanning\n                matrix structure, which would allow the cable to encode the keys in only 16 wires. Figuring this out\n                proved to be the hardest part of the project as there wasn't any documentation form the keyboard.\n                I sat down with a multimeter and tested different configurations until I finally recognized the pattern.\n            </p>\n            <img src={multimeter_pic} className='ppage-img-vertical' />\n            <p>\n                In this case, setting \n                one of the first 8 wires to ground would set the last 8 wires to measure a specific group of 8 keys.\n                As you changed which of the first wires is pulled low, the last 8 wires would change to measure a\n                different group of 8 keys. If you quickly cycle through the first 8 wires and record the last 8 wires\n                at each step, you effectively measure all of the keys.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n                From there, it was a matter of programming the arduino to cycle through the possible states and store the\n                values. The data was then converted to MIDI using an arduino library and sent to the computer over USB.\n                This was very effective, and the keyboard was immediately recognizable as a MIDI device and was compatible\n                with the software I was using.\n            </p>\n            <img src={arduino_pic} className='ppage-img' />\n            <p>\n                I definitely learned a lot about how to try and reverse-engineer something to figure out how it works.

At some point over the summer I started to solder it as a more permanent solution (and because I needed\n                the breadboard) but was unable to finish before moving out.

This site is a little different, so I had to take the time to make sure it was mobile friendly.
