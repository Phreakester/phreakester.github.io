Being able to quickly adapt to sudden changes is especially important to us because of the nature of the offroad competition, where hitting rocks and other debris is to be expected. While I previously had no experience with PID controllers, I was able to learn about how they work and why they are used. In addition, I gained experience tuning the controller and helped to develop some of the code calculating and sending the output signal to the motor."}),Object(d.jsx)("p",{children:"I also gained new leadership experience while being able to apply my previous leadership knowledge. As the club is composed mainly of Mechanical Engineers, I gave a lecture on git and version control and what best practices for those tools are. This allowed me to better keep track of which team member was tackling each project, and make sure that blocking issues didn't slow down development. It also allowed us to simultaneously develop multiple features using a branch/pull request workflow, increasing efficiency. In addition, through the pull requests I was able to ensure that the merged code adhered to our coding standards and format. I also gained experience using PlatformIO to develop and build on the microcontroller instead of using the Arduino IDE as I had previously done."}),Object(d.jsx)("img",{src:$,alt:"Me in an offroad
