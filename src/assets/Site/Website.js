                Development on this site began far into my first year at UCLA. Original implementation of the site involved
                only HTML and CSS, but to gain more experience using the tools I would use in teachLA, I switched
                to being JS and React based. While the site isn't super interactive, it still allowed me to gain more practice
                with the Github workflow as well as JS development as a whole.

                The site uses BrowserRouter to achieve a multi-page effect. It also is able to dynamically add projects to 
                the projects page based off of a config file. This allows me to quickly update the page without having to
                hardcode it every time.
