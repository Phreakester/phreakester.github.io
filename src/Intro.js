                Hello! My name is Getty, and welcome to my personal website! Its a collection of some of my favorite projects
                that Ive worked on throughout my life. I spent a lot of time to make this website something I could be proud of, including
                a great deal of interactivity. So please dont just glace at my resume (although if you must it can be found below)

                Thank you very much for your time! -Getty V
